Amazon Web Services (AWS),adopt,platforms,TRUE,"<a href='https://aws.amazon.com/'>AWS</a> is a strategic public cloud provider for IAG. We have been using it since 2015, and we have a number of people with skills in using its service offerings to deliver applications.<br>Its strength is its extensive IaaS offering, but it also has PaaS and SaaS offerings.",
AWS Route 53,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"<a href='https://aws.amazon.com/route53/'>Route 53</a> should be utilised for solutions in AWS for both centralisation of domain registration and DNS management. Centralisation of registration in AWS allows for automatic renewal and clear inventory of domain ownership. DNS management should remain with the domain and will enable further automation of cloud-based solutions.",
Docker,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"<a href='https://www.docker.com/'>Docker</a> provides process isolation, a standardised packaging format, and a programming language agnostic runtime for both long- and short-lived processes.<br>It's fast becoming the de-facto application packaging and deployment standard at IAG.<br>We however do <i>not</i> recommend it for running databases outside of developer workstations.",
Hashicorp Vault,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"<a href='https://www.vaultproject.io/'>Vault</a> is a tool for securely accessing secrets. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, database credentials, certificates, and more. Vault provides a unified interface to any secret, while providing tight access control and recording a detailed audit log.The key features of Vault are: <ul><li><b>Secure Secret Storage:</b>Arbitrary key/value secrets can be stored in Vault. Vault encrypts these secrets prior to writing them to persistent storage, so gaining access to the raw storage isn't enough to access your secrets. Vault can write to disk, Consul, and more.</li> <li><b>Dynamic Secrets:</b> Vault can generate secrets on-demand for some systems, such as AWS or SQL databases. For example, when an application needs to access an S3 bucket, it asks Vault for credentials, and Vault will generate an AWS keypair with valid permissions on demand. After creating these dynamic secrets, Vault will also automatically revoke them after the lease is up.</li> <li><b>Data Encryption:</b> Vault can encrypt and decrypt data without storing it. This allows security teams to define encryption parameters and developers to store encrypted data in a location such as SQL without having to design their own encryption methods.</li> <li><b>Leasing and Renewal:</b> All secrets in Vault have a lease associated with them. At the end of the lease, Vault will automatically revoke that secret. Clients are able to renew leases via built-in renew APIs.</li> <li><b>Revocation:</b> Vault has built-in support for secret revocation. Vault can revoke not only single secrets, but a tree of secrets, for example all secrets read by a specific user, or all secrets of a particular type. Revocation assists in key rolling as well as locking down systems in the case of an intrusion.</li></ul>",
Object storage for heavy duty data storage,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"Object storage services such as AWS S3 are specifically designed for large-scale data storage (rather than trying to implement NFS in EC2, etc.); just be sure to secure it appropriately.",
Object storage for static microsites,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"For static microsites (such as this radar!), it is possible to leverage the serverless nature of various cloud services to provide a functional, scalable and low cost solution. For instance, the use of S3 as file storage, CloudFront to support distribution and encryption-in-transit, and WAF (web application firewall) to limit connectivity to internal IAG users.",

For material workloads operating in line with the <a href='https://confluence.iag.com.au/display/ILA/Cloud+Strategy+and+Architecture'>IAG Public Cloud Strategy</a>, it is imperative that we investigate the suitability of Google Cloud's Compute Engine and related services as a comparable IaaS platform providing the resilience and recovery capabilities we need.",
Kubernetes,trial,platforms,TRUE,"<a href='https://kubernetes.io/'>Kubernetes</a> is fast becoming the industry de-facto standard for container orchestration that can be used both in public clouds and on-premise. It's based on <a href='http://blog.kubernetes.io/2015/04/borg-predecessor-to-kubernetes.html'>Borg</a>, which is Google's internal large-scale cluster management system, and many of the developers on Kubernetes are former Borg developers.<br>AWS, GCP and Azure all have managed Kubernetes offerings.<br>Rancher 2.x, Pivotal Container Service, and OpenShift 3.x are examples of open source platforms that build on Kubernetes.",
SaaS source code repositories,trial,platforms,TRUE,Using a SaaS provider for high performing distributed version control systems is highly desirable for teams who want to maintain the agility required to collaborate effectively and at mass scale. It eliminates the need to manage infrastructure and operating systems, reducing bottlenecks and lead times often experienced when managing and configuring services all whilst using a pay as you go model.,
AWS Elastic BeanStalk,assess,platforms,TRUE,"<a href='https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/'>Elastic Beanstalk</a> is a PaaS offering for simple application deployment.

Cloud Foundry Application Runtime,hold,platforms,TRUE,"<a href='https://www.cloudfoundry.org/application-runtime/'>Cloud Foundry Application Runtime</a> is an open-source container-based PaaS. It was created before Docker gained widespread adoption, and so it has been using its own container format (Warden), container scheduler, and provisioning tool (BOSH). The latest version has added support for Docker as the container format and Kubernetes as the scheduler, with BOSH being retained for provisioning.<br>Several vendors (IBM, Pivotal and others) have commercial offerings for both public cloud and on-premise hosting.<br>The main reasons for putting it on hold are (i) uncertainty around the strategic direction for the overall Cloud Foundry platform now that it encompasses two significantly different runtimes (application vs container); and (ii) the use of BOSH for provisioning, as it's a tool that has limited adoption outside Cloud Foundry.",
Cloud service brokers,hold,platforms,TRUE,"Cloud service brokers typically offer one or more of the following capabilities: intermediation, aggregation, or arbitrage. In doing so, they add cost (licensing/subscription for the broker), complexity (another layer of abstraction and management required), and reduce services available to the lowest common denominator, eliminating unique benefits of the leading providers. In the past, the <a href='https://www.rightscale.com/products-and-services/products/cloud-management-platform'>RightScale Cloud Management Platform</a> performed this role at IAG. However, cross-cloud service provider tools and frameworks such as Terraform, Packer, and container orchestrators have now reached a level of maturity where brokers are no longer necessary, and where the cost and complexity they add no longer outweigh the benefits. Given this development, we have successfully replaced RightScale with these tools at IAG.",

Ansible for host provisioning,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"<a href='https://www.ansible.com/'>Ansible</a> is an open source configuration management framework for automating host provisioning, supported by Red Hat. Compared to similar frameworks such as Puppet and Chef, Ansible doesn't require agents to run on hosts that are being managed. It also supports environment provisioning but we advise teams to use CloudFormation or Terraform for this purpose instead, as Ansible doesn't provide a good mechanism for tracking the state of the environment.",
AWS CloudFormation,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"<a href='https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/'>CloudFormation</a> is an environment provisioning service for AWS resources that allows us to define infrastructure as code. Compared to provider agnostic tools such as Terraform, the main benefits of using CloudFormation are (i) early support for new AWS offerings; and (ii) the environment state is kept in AWS, which significantly simplified state management. For these reason it's ideally suited to AWS-specific workloads. It supports both YAML and JSON syntax for its templates, and teams have been reporting that the newer YAML syntax is more readable.",

The pattern is to have a pipline that will build and test your configuration code and push to object storage (e.g. S3). When a machine image is baked the configuration code executes. Once the machine image is built the configuration that needs to be done at run-time should be minimal and any further configuration should be discovered from the environment using tags, labels, environment parameters (e.g. from Consul), DNS etc. The advantages are time-to-boot (minimal configuation at run-time), no need for extra servers to push from, no need for extra firewall rules to push from, and  the configuration is versioned and that version is associated with the machine image.",
Linux Security Modules,trial,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Security_Modules'>Linux Security Modules</a> are typically implemented by Linux distributions in the form of SELinux or AppArmor.

FaaS as enterprise glue,trial,techniques,TRUE,"Products such as <a href='https://confluence.iag.com.au/display/IA/Watchmen+Admin+and+Architecture'>IAG Watchmen</a> show that function-as-a-service (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions) can be a great choice for combining different services in a lightweight manner without having to provision hosts ('serverless').",
Normalised repository entrypoints,trial,techniques,TRUE,"It is likely that your platform or even team will have tens if not hundreds of heterogenous software repositories within their domain. In practically every one of those repositories, a user will have a need to perform standard actions such as (but not limited to): bootstrap, build, test, run. <i>Normalised repository entrypoints</i> represents a collective standardisation on a wrapper pattern or tool within the group. This allows intricacies of test commands, linting tools, compile flags etc. to be managed by maintainers; individual contributors need only to know the normalised entrypoint commands. Consider popular language agnostic tooling like GNU/BSD Makefiles, Shell (see: Github's <a href='https://githubengineering.com/scripts-to-rule-them-all'>Scripts To Rule Them All</a>) or the emerging <a href='https://bazel.build'>Bazel</a>.",
Polycloud,trial,techniques,TRUE,Polycloud is a approach that advocates enabling the use of multiple cloud service providers in a business,and choosing the most appropriate providers and services on a per workload basis. It is distinct from 'hybrid cloud' in that it's not an attempt at treating all clouds as equivalent providers of commodity services,rather it focuses on taking advantage of unique services of each provider.,
External escalation service,assess,techniques,TRUE,"Tools such as PagerDuty and OpsDuty monitor from outside the network, so their availability is not impacted by issues in the corporate network.

More specifically, service mesh tools provide platforms to connect, manage, and secure microservices promising to take care of routing, rerouting for graceful degradation and secure inter-service communications. They also promise to abstract away the networking and messaging layers. The two main offerings currently are <a href='https://istio.io/'>Apache Istio</a> and <a href='https://linkerd.io/'>Linkerd</a>,
Enterprise singletons,hold,techniques,TRUE,"An Enterprise Singleton is an infrastructure component that you can only afford a one or two of. Examples are Mainframes, physical Load balancing and Security Appliances. Incorporating such a component into a system landscape severely restricts testability and deployment flexibility as they can't be set up and torn down easily. They also have a tendency to promote vendor lock-in and sunk-cost fallacy influencing architectural decisions.",
FaaS for business APIs,hold,techniques,TRUE,"We advocate caution in using function-as-a-service (FaaS) offerings to provide business level APIs in place of 'traditional' services for anything beyond very simple use cases. They are typically proprietary to each cloud services provider and work best when combined with other proprietary services from the same provider. As an example, if integration with a traditional relational database is required, FaaS cannot take advantage of connection pooling due to the ephemeral nature of the execution environment.",
GitFlow,hold,techniques,TRUE,"<a href='https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html'>GitFlow</a> is a branching model popularised by Github. We firmly believe that long-lived version-control branches harm valuable engineering practices such as continuous integration. Most teams we see using GitFlow abuse its branch-heavy workflow, which encourages late integration.",
Manual configuration,hold,techniques,TRUE,"With the advances that have been taking place in both environment and host provisioning, and with all the <a href='https://landing.google.com/sre/book.html'>well-publicised benefits of automated configuration management</a>, there is simply no excuse for manual configuration of environments or software. We advocate eliminating technologies that cannot be easily configured through available open source tools.",
Multiple paths to production,hold,techniques,TRUE,"For various historical and technological reasons, IAG continues to be a difficult landscape for a development team to operate a CD pipeline. There are still multiple enterprise-wide test environments used by key systems of record that in turn represent multiple paths for those systems to push features into production. Compounded by tight coupling, integration development with these systems often necessitates slotting into the same delivery cadence and matching of environment paths, both of which are common bottlenecks for continuous delivery at IAG today. There are a number of remediation techniques that can be considered such as: service versioning, <a href='https://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html'>contract testing</a>, stubbing, decoupling deployment from release (see: <a href='https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html'>feature toggles</a>) and more generally planning such that the integration target goes to production first, before your feature build.",
The term 'private cloud',hold,techniques,TRUE,"Using the term 'private cloud' to refer to API-enabled on-premise virtualised infrastructure is misleading and causes confusion. Fundamentally the pricing model is the same as traditional on-premise infrastructure: capital expenditure, the functionality offered by so-called 'private clouds' doesn't match that of public clouds both in terms of breath of features or depth of integration, and the term has led to confusion with people working at the industry regulator. For this reason we'll refrain from using the term 'private cloud' from now on. We'll instead use 'on-premise', or 'dedicated API-enabled infrastructure.'",
AWS PrivateLink for AWS Services,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"TL:DR you don't need an internet gateway (egress) for everyday tasks. We can significantly improve the security posture of EC2 instances by configuring AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Kinesis Streams, Service Catalog and EC2 Systems Manager to use an interface VPC endpoint NOTE: this is not AWS PrivateLink for IAG Services",
AWS PrivateLink for IAG Services,trial,platforms,TRUE,"TL:DR you don't need multiple AWS Direct Connect Connections or VPC Peering connections for everyday tasks. We can significantly improve the delivery and security of IAG services between AWS accounts and safely expose services from the MDC & WMDC an interface VPC endpoint NOTE: this is not AWS PrivateLink for AWS Services",
